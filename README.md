# -Social-Media-Link-Prediction-using-Hybrid-GNN-Models
This repository contains the implementation of a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) for social media link prediction. It integrates GCN, GAT, and MPNN to enhance accuracy in predicting relationships. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and benchmarking. Developed in Python using PyTorch &amp; PyG.
